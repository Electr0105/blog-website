title: "The Resume Cloud Challenge"
sub-title: Hands-On Cloud Experience

---

After passing my AZ-104, I needed a new challenge, something practical to apply what I'd learned. That’s when I discovered the Cloud Resume Challenge by Forrest Brazeal: a full-stack cloud project that tests your skills by building a public resume site powered by serverless Azure infrastructure.

While I’ve built and deployed applications to a local environment as part of my role as Systems Administrator, I hadn’t exactly dipped my toes into the world of cloud development. This looked to be a fantastic way to change that!

My site is available at https://resume.gleesonlabs.com/

And the source code is available here https://github.com/Electr0105/resume-website
